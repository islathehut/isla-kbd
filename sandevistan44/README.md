# sandevistan44

A 44-key split keyboard inspired by the [corne](https://github.com/foostan/crkbd), [torn](https://github.com/rtitmuss/torn), and [0xCB Static](https://0xcb.dev/static/).

> :warning: **Warning:** This is very much a work in progress!  Use these designs at your own risk!

# Features

* corne stagger 3x6 main rows
* 4-key splayed thumb rows
* 2" IPS display
* 34mm trackball via [vik](https://github.com/sadekbaroudi/vik) and dedicated left and right mouse buttons
* Kailh Choc v2 with hotswap
* Pro Micro-footprint MCUs (primary support for RP2040 controllers like the [0xCB Helios](https://github.com/0xCB-dev/0xCB-Helios))
* Top-mounted through-hole diodes
* [vik](https://github.com/sadekbaroudi/vik) support on the right side (designed around using vik for the trackball but could be used for [any vik module](https://github.com/sadekbaroudi/vik/tree/master/pcb))
