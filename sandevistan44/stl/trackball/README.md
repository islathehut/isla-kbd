# 34mm Trackball Mount

The trackball holder is based on [Wimads' design](https://github.com/Wimads/Trackball-mousekeys-add-on-for-Skeletyl/blob/main/stl/Trackball-holder-v2_v221116.stl) and uses the same [VCN310 BTUs](https://www.aliexpress.us/w/wholesale-vcn310.html).  If you use this mount you'll need 3 BTUs.
