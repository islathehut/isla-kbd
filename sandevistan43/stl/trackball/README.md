# Trackball

## PCB Mount

The PCB mount is designed around the [vik PMW3610-xs sensor PCB](https://github.com/sadekbaroudi/vik/tree/master/pcb/pmw3610-xs) and all of my trackball mounts are meant to interface with this mount.  If you use a trackball with my boards you'll need to use this mount/PCB/sensor or come up with your own setup.

## 34mm Trackball Mount

The 34mm trackball holder is based on [Wimads' design](https://github.com/Wimads/Trackball-mousekeys-add-on-for-Skeletyl/blob/main/stl/Trackball-holder-v2_v221116.stl) and uses the same [VCN310 BTUs](https://www.aliexpress.us/w/wholesale-vcn310.html).  If you use this mount you'll need 3 BTUs.

## 43mm Trackball Mount

_TBD_

## 55mm Trackball Mount

The 55mm trackball holder is based on the [Cosmos Keyboards' 55mm BTU trackball mount](https://github.com/rianadon/Cosmos-Keyboards) and uses the [VCN310 BTUs](https://www.aliexpress.us/w/wholesale-vcn310.html).  If you use this mount you'll need 3 BTUs.
